# Basic Linux Commands

The below is a list of common Linux commands and a brief explanation for them

1. **`pwd`** - displays the present working directory
2. **`ls`** - lists all files and directories in the current working directory

3. `>` takes the standard output of the command on the left and redirects it to the file on the right. For example:
```
$ cat football.txt > cricket.txt
```

4. `>>` takes the standard output of the command on the left and appends (adds) it to the end of the file on the right. For example: 
```
$ cat scores.txt > results.txt
