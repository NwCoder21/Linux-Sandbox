# Users, Groups, and Permissions in Linux - Introduction

Linux is a highly secure operating system. How? This lesson will dig into the way that Linux handles users, groups, and permissions to keep information secure.

Linux is designed from the ground up to prevent individual users from accessing areas of the file structure they shouldn’t access. Linux environment administrators have to define separate accounts and permissions to determine who can access specific files, directories, applications, and resources.

Throughout the lesson, we’ll go over:

* Classification of Linux users
* Users and groups
* File permissions
* Modifying users, groups, and permissions
* Admin-related commands

# Types of Linux Users

Again, Linux is a highly secure operating system that depends on strict file permissions dictating which users and groups can access them. Let’s look at some classifications of users that are found on a Linux system.

## Admin or Non-admin?

A Linux user is either an administrator or non-administrator. The administrator is a superuser (or root user) with full control over the entire system. With that in mind, it is important to ensure that only a very limited number of folks have read and write permissions on all the files in the entire system. In contrast, a non-administrator by default has limited (or no) access to certain system/configuration files.

## Normal user

A majority of the accounts will be non-administrators. These users can be divided into two subtypes: normal user or system user. Normal users are real people. The individual is given a user account for login and limited access to computer applications, files, and resources.

## System user

A system user is typically a non-human or computer-generated account. System users are created to run a specific program or process/daemon such as a web server or backup program. This type of “user” is limited in control and is assigned only enough access to manage its particular process.

# Users and Groups in Linux

Now that we’ve covered how different Linux users can coexist, let’s learn about users, groups, and their IDs!

On a Linux system, all users added are assigned a name, unique user identification (UID), group, and group identification (GID). When a user is initially created, a new UID and matching GID are assigned.

UID and matching GID numbers are assigned based on the type of user:

* Administrator (root): UID and GID = 0
* System user (computer-generated): UID and GID assigned from 1 to 999
* Normal users (real people): UID and GID = 1000 or greater, incremented with every new user

The new user is by default assigned a matching group name (and typically a matching GID) so that the user will be a member of their own group. For example, a user stephen (UID = 1000) will also be assigned to the group stephen (GID = 1000).

We can create groups and add users to them. For example, in our diagram, we have a group called **Business** that includes the user **Tony**. Users can also exist in more than one group as well.

We can use the `id` and `groups` commands in the terminal to check our `uid` and `gid`:

Admin users can also view and modify the user and group information stored in the read-only **/etc/passwd** and **/etc/group files**.

Up next, we’ll talk about how users and groups relate to file permissions.

# Instructions

---

Step 1: Let’s use the `id` command in the terminal to see our own `UID`, `GID`, and group memberships. Currently, our username is `ccuser`.

Solution:

Hint: The command structure is:

```yaml
id [username]
```

---

Step 2: Now, let’s use the `groups` command in the terminal to see a list of groups that we are members of. So far, `ccuser` should be the only group.

Hint: The command structure is:

```yaml
groups [username]
```
