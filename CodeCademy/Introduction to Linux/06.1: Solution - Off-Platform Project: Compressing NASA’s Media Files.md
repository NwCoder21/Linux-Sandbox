# Solution -Off-Platform Project: Compressing NASA’s Media Files

# Project Setup

Before we get started, make sure you are in your Linux environment, whether you are in a VirtualBox or access Linux natively. Open up the Terminal app.

We need to install a utility called `iftop` to your command line, which allows us to monitor our network. 

Step 1: In the terminal, run the command:

```
sudo apt -y install iftop
```

We will use iftop to observe the download progress and ensure we are correctly able to download the zip archive. The rest of the commands are the ones you’ve learned from our Linux Bash lessons so far!

# Project Instructions

## Downloading the Files and Monitoring Network

1.  Open two terminal windows and stack them side by side. You can do this by opening one terminal window and either:
    * right-click in the terminal and click “New Window” or
    * run the command gnome-terminal in the terminal

or

---

2. In one of the terminal windows, run the sudo iftop command (you may be prompted for your account password to use sudo) 

Solution:

---

3. In the other terminal, change the terminal working directory to Desktop.

---

4. Check whether the server that hosts the **media.zip** file is reachable since Neil warned you that it might not be. Send 5 packets to `static-assets.codecademy.com` using the `ping` command with the `-c` (count) option.

You will notice network traffic with bandwidth usage being printed out in the terminal window running the iftop command. 

Solution:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/76591db2-b483-46a9-b7c5-dcfd18085fcc)

As it's sending packages to the host, we can see the network traffic and bandwidth usage in the terminal running the `iftop` command.

Hint: If you need a reminder on how to use the `ping -c` option, use `man` to pull up the manual page for `ping`.

---

Step 5: Use the `wget` or `curl` command to download **media.zip** from the url: `https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-linux/nasa-media-off-platform-project/media.zip`. 

Solution:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/d01d150b-eab8-4f96-90ec-eaec3911850c)

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/05358cf5-09e7-44a1-bc51-cbb322ec38eb)

While the file is downloading, `iftop` will show the source address of the file and the bandwidth usage. You may close the `iftop` terminal when the file is downloaded

---

Step 6: Extract the downloaded archive file to the current Desktop.

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/ef797ca9-a16b-49f5-81e4-d9e3d4eedf9d)

Now that we have the archive file, we need to extract it. Notice the extension of the archives is `.zip`. To extract zip files, we use the `unzip` command.

Solution:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/cf41ae84-c1a1-4e16-b039-7ff10b7b5ad5)

```
unzip media.zip
```

---

Step 7: View the files in the extracted media directory using either the Ubuntu file explorer or in the terminal. 

If we go to the File Explorer, we will see:

# Organizing and Compressing Files for Distribution

In this section, we encourage you to use commands like `ls` to check the progress of the tasks in between instructions. You can also always refer to the `man` or `info` pages for any of the commands if you need a reminder on how to place options and arguments for the compression/archiving commands!

---

Step 8: Change the terminal working directory to `media`.

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/630c3c46-321b-44a6-80b4-6805e15e8ccc)

---

Step 9: Create a directory called `compressed_photos` and move all the photos (files with the `.jpg` extension) to this directory.

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/4cc0f802-c4b9-4d93-8691-1de0750243d7)

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/fa60d6de-245d-4bc1-89f7-71488e0071f7)

---

Step 10: Compress all the files in the `compressed_photos` directory using the `gzip` compression command.

Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/62124df3-6bed-4503-a0f4-ad8de1899a54)

We can also use the `*.jpg` wilcard instead of the `-r` option. The `-r` option is to compress everything in a folder.

---

Also, in the `compressed_photos` folder, we can now see that each file ends with a `gz` extension. 

---

Step 11: Create a compressed `tar` archive named `videos.tar.bz2` of all the videos (files with `.mp4` extension). Be patient. This might take a while. 

Note: When using the `tar` command, use the `--remove-files` option to remove the original files.

Solution:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/e88bba1d-e817-4714-9b56-3abed085801a)

---

Another way is to first create a `tar` archive first using:

```
tar -cf videos.tar *.mp4
```

and then compress the archive using `bzip2:

```
bzip2 videos.tar
```

---


Step 12: Compress the audio file with the `.mp3` extension using the `xz` compression utility.


Solution:

Can either use:

```
xz "Tsunami Waves Recorded by Voyager 1.mp3" 
```

or use the wildcard `*.mp3`

```
xz *.mp3
```

# Conclusion

You did it! You used terminal commands to download files from an online host, used compression tools to reduce the size of files, and sorted media files into directories, all from commands in the Terminal!

We hope you are only getting more comfortable with the terminal as a versatile tool for all these operations. The power of these Bash utilities in the Linux Shell is exactly what makes Linux such a lightweight family of operating systems.

If you need any extra guidance, we have a project walkthrough video below, and the solution commands are in the file called solution.txt which can be downloaded at the URL:
