# Introduction

In this lesson, we will explore the potential of Bash scripting. Since we can run any terminal command in a Bash script, there are truly endless possibilities. The ability to execute and link multiple commands with programming logic allows us to easily automate tasks and run configuration services.

Bash scripts are often the backbone of many services and servers! In the industry, scripts are commonly used for:

* Application installation or deployment. A script can contain instructions to compile, configure, and execute an application. Packages downloaded via the terminal with `wget` or `curl` are often installed and configured to the environment using scripts.
Automating tasks during a [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) job, which essentially schedules scripts to run. For example, a cron job might trigger a script to periodically check the health of a web API and set off an alert if the service is unreachable.

Scripts are great tools that can also be referred to by other scripts! That means we can reuse scripts others write on the internet.

In this lesson, we will practice writing two scripts:

* One that prints a file directory structure in a tree-like format.
* One that prints song lyrics and has the user guess the song name.

---

Step 1: As a preview, let’s run the scripts we will be writing.

First, run `./tree.sh ~` on the terminal. This script prints the directory structure of the current directory.

Solution:

---

Step 2: Run `./lyrics.sh -a Adele -s Rolling in the Deep` in terminal.

This script fetches the lyrics of the requested song. We will be using this script to develop our game in a later exercise.

Solution:

# Print Directory Structure Script I

Let’s work on a basic script that prints a directory structure in a tree format, which is useful for viewing nested subdirectories. The script takes advantage of the powerful commands that the Linux shell provides for file and folder operations.

We will be using conditional statements as well as the following commands:

* `echo`
* `cd`
* `pwd`
* `ls`
* `grep`
* `sed`
* `wc`

This script will take in an optional string argument: the parent directory that should be the starting point for the tree. If this is not provided, we will use the current working directory. We will print a message if the parent directory has no subfolders to print. If we find there are subfolders to print, we’ll use a combination of the commands `ls`, `grep`, and `sed` to print the directory structure tree.

We will be working on the script named `tree.sh`, which is already opened in the editor.

---

# Instructions

---

Step 1: Let’s begin by checking the `tree.sh` script to see if an input argument was provided. If so, we should change the current working directory to that argument.

In the code editor, where there’s a comment in the file, add a conditional statement that:

* Checks if `$1` was not equal to an empty string `""`
* If so, the script should `cd` to `$1`

Remember to use quotes around `$1`!

Click the `Run` button when you are done.

Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/31a77b24-db64-45ad-8b61-6cfd138386af)

Hint: Add the following lines after the comment:

```yaml
if [ "$1" != "" ]
   then cd "$1"
fi
```

---

Step 2: After the conditional statement, use the `pwd` command to print out the current working directory.

Click the `Run` button when you are done.

---

Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/32df011f-ac1e-4170-add6-da5d4acae229)

---

Hint: The code should now look like the following:

```yaml
if [ "$1" != "" ]
   then cd "$1"
fi
 
pwd

```

---

Step 3: Next, use the following in a conditional statement to check if no subdirectories exist under the parent directory.

```yaml
`ls -F -1 | grep "/" | wc -l` = 0
```

The logic behind the statement:

> The provided conditional statement uses `ls` lists files and directories with indicators one line at a time. `grep` is then used to find the `/` indicator which implies a directory. If the line count calculated by `wc -l` is `0`, then no subdirectories exist. 

If the above statement is true, use `echo` to print `" -> no sub-directories"`.

Click the `Run` button when you are done.

Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/4f0b1968-a112-4542-9308-1bf27b22e548)


```yaml
#!/bin/bash

# Begin code below:
# If input argument, cd to the directory in the input argument

if [ "$1" != "" ]
   then cd "$1"
fi

pwd

if [ `ls -F -1 | grep "/" | wc -l` = 0 ]
  then echo " -> no sub-directories"
fi
```

Hint: Add the following lines after the `pwd` line:

```yaml
if [ `ls -F -1 | grep "/" | wc -l` = 0 ]
   then echo "   -> no sub-directories"
fi
```

---

Step 4: After script is in the right directory, use the `ls` command with the `-R` option to print subdirectories recursively. This prints out all the files, categorized by the directories they are located inside.

Click the `Run` button when you are done.

---

Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/8d08be3a-682c-4c53-a103-b68c238daaf2)

```yaml
#!/bin/bash

# Begin code below:
# If input argument, cd to the directory in the input argument

if [ "$1" != "" ]
   then cd "$1"
fi

pwd

if [ `ls -F -1 | grep "/" | wc -l` = 0 ]
  then echo " -> no sub-directories"
fi

ls -R
```
---

Hint: Add the following line:

```yaml
ls -R
```

---

Step 5: Run `./tree.sh ~` with the home (`~`) directory as the input argument.

Notice how the output includes all subdirectories but also all the files in those directories as well. We will filter out individual files and format the output in the next exercise!

---

Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/fac4d295-d3a0-452e-8e8c-ae6dbf120efa)

Hint: Run `./tree.sh ~` in the terminal.

---

# Print Directory Structure Script II

Let’s continue to work on the script that prints the directory structure tree. At the end of the last exercise, our script was able to print all nested subdirectories and files under a parent directory. In this exercise, we will add to the script. We’ll use the `grep` command to filter this output to only include subdirectories, not files, and format it to better match a tree-like structure using `sed`.

The left side of the image below shows what our script’s output looks like now. The right side is what it will look like after adding the `grep` and `sed` commands. 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/c7a17d1f-3287-4da0-9fdf-8089c695b70a)

As you can see, the directory structure is a lot easier to follow after we will use the `sed` command to:

* Remove colons
* Use dashes (`-`) to differentiate between directory and sub-directory
* Indent to the right by three spaces
* Replace the first dash with a vertical bar (`|`)

Let’s make the output look nice!

---

# Instructions

---

Step 1: In our current output, the lines for directories end with the character `:` while the lines with the files do not. We can use `grep` to keep only the lines where the last character is “`:`”.

In the line of the script where we currently have `ls -R`, let’s add on by piping `|` the output from the `ls -R` to `grep ":$"`. ( `$` is a regex symbol that matches characters at the end of a string).

Click the `Run` button when you are done.

Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/6eb61704-12cd-4152-94e7-4bdcfecbcd5e)

---

Hint: Pipe `grep ":$"` to `ls` so it looks like:

```yaml
ls -R | grep ":$"
```

---

Step 2: `Run` the script with `~` (the home directory) as input to see the difference the `grep` command has made!

Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/3282439d-07a1-4f2e-b0c6-811f7273cf11)

Hint: Run `./tree.sh ~` in the terminal.

---

Step 3: Now that we just have the subdirectories listed, we can use `sed` to transform the output to remove colons and include indents and dashes. Add a pipe after the `ls -R | grep ":$"` statement and attach the command

```yaml
sed -e 's/:$//' -e 's/[^-][^\/]*\//--/g' -e 's/^/   /' -e 's/-/|/'
```

Pro tip: To help with readability, you can use a backslash `\` to break the long line into two.

Click the `Run` button when you are done.

An explanation of the ``sed`` expressions

The `-e` option allows us to use multiple expressions in the same `sed` command.

The first expression, `'s/:$//'`, removes all colons at the end of each line.
The second expresion, `'s/[^-][^\/]*\//--/g'`, essentially replaces all `/` with `--`.

---

Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/d43f73fa-e235-461e-8c58-f6f667b5a55a)

---

Hint: The multi-line command should now be:

```yaml
ls -R | grep ":$" | \
   sed -e 's/:$//' -e 's/[^-][^\/]*\//--/g' -e 's/^/   /' -e 's/-/|/'
```

---

Step 4: For additional spacing, add an `echo` command with no arguments to the beginning and the end of the script. In other words, `echo` should print an empty string.

Click the `Run` button when you are done.

---

Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/9817d1c1-d39b-452c-a0e2-364c84873eaf)

---

Hint: Add the line

```
echo
```

right after `#!/bin/bash` and the `sed` command.


---

Step 5: And we’re done! Run the script with `~` as input to see the results of your hard work!

Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/abacbd09-ef29-496c-8655-9bb51d052f77)

```yaml
#!/bin/bash

echo 

# If input argument exists, cd into that directory
if [ "$1" != "" ]
   then cd "$1"
fi

pwd

# If no subdirectories, print "no sub-directories"
if [ `ls -F -1 | grep "/" | wc -l` = 0 ]   # Check if no folders
   then echo "   -> no sub-directories"
fi

# ls -R print recursively
# Code: pipe this command to filter for directories
ls -R | grep ":$" | \
   sed -e 's/:$//' -e 's/[^-][^\/]*\//--/g' -e 's/^/   /' -e 's/-/|/'

echo
```

---

Hint: Run `./tree.sh ~` in the terminal.

---

# Using Scripts Inside Scripts

The script we completed in the last exercise could have been a one-line terminal command run inside the desired working directory:

```yaml
ls -R | grep ':$' | sed -e 's/:$//' -e 's/[^-][^\/]*\//--/g' -e 's/^/   /' -e 's/-/|/'
```

But this is a lot to type, and it’s easier to edit and reuse a script. With a script, we can also save input arguments and provide additional options to the user. Then, we can share the script with anyone! The `tree.sh` script that we recreated in the last two exercises was [originally written by Dem Pilafian](https://centerkey.com/tree/).

Such powerful open-source scripts are available all over the internet and we should absolutely take advantage of them. We can use scripts inside our scripts as well! For example, a more feature-packed version of the tree script is available [by Steve Baker at Indiana State University](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/). We can install this script via this simple command in our own terminal:

```yaml
apt-get install tree
```

Baker’s version features many options and better formatting thanks to several developers who contributed to it. Note the documentation as well!

Some developers have made collections of several handy scripts. One collection, called [Bash-Snippets](https://github.com/alexanderepstein/Bash-Snippets), provides many helpful utilities for the command line such as looking up the weather, converting currency, performing advanced numerical calculations, and even creating memes We can reuse these scripts in our own scripts!

In the next exercise, we will be using one of the scripts from the Bash-Snippets package to create a song-guessing game script.

---

# Instructions

---

Step 1: We downloaded the script `weather.sh` from Bash-Snippets. Check its usage with the command `./weather.sh -h`. The `-h` option is programmed into the script.


Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/fcbc0a36-d40d-46c3-9301-b9fe4660cf1e)

---

Step 2: Get the weather of `Tokyo` using the weather script `./weather.sh "Tokyo"`.

If the output looks strange, try maximizing the terminal window or adjust your screen size.

# Making A Guess-the-Song Script

In this exercise, we will be adding script code to build a simple game where the users guess the name of a song when its lyrics are outputted to the terminal. You may be wondering, how do we load in lyrics? We will take advantage of the script we ran in the introduction which fetches lyrics from the Internet. This lyrics script is a modified version of the [lyrics script provided through Bash-Snippets](https://github.com/alexanderepstein/Bash-Snippets/blob/master/lyrics/lyrics).

We have provided a code skeleton for the script we are writing in the file named `song_guesser.sh`, which is already opened in the code editor. As a quick overview, the code contains:

* A `while` loop to continuously run the game until the user wishes to stop.
* A `GenerateRandomArtistAndSong` function that populates the variables `artist_name` and `song_name` with a random song name and its artist.
* Statements to print the lyrics into the terminal and prompt the user to make a guess.
* Statements to tell the user whether they guessed the right song name and if they wish to play again.

To fill in the script, we will pass the song name and the artist to the `lyrics.sh` script, retrieve the lyrics returned from that script, and output it in this `song_guesser.sh` script. Let’s begin!

---

# Instructions

  artist_name=$(jq -r '.artist' <<< "$song")
  song_name=$(jq -r '.song' <<< "$song")
}

echo "Welcome to the Song Guesser!"
echo "Ready to play? (y/n)"
read -r play

while [ "$play" == "y" ]  # Loop until the user answers "y"
do
  echo "Fetching lyrics..."
  echo
  sleep 3  

# Calls the function to get a random song and its respective artist
  GenerateRandomArtistAndSong 
  # Call the lyrics script to get the lyrics of the song below:
  
  
  echo "$lyrics"
  echo

  echo "Guess the name of the song or its artist"
  read -r guess
  guess=$(echo "$guess" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | xargs)  # Lowercase the guess, trim whitespaces

  # Checks if the user's guess matches the artist or song name
  if [[ "$guess" == "$song_name" || "$guess" == "$artist_name" ]]
  then
    echo "You got it!"
  else
    echo "Incorrect!"

Step 1: Before we use it in our own script, let’s see how the `lyrics.sh` script works. Switch the editor to the file `lyrics.sh` and skim through. Let’s run the command `./lyrics.sh -h` in the terminal to see the usage.

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/a51334cb-ef1f-4780-b320-5dc2e651f026)


We see that we can pass the `artist_name` argument using the `-a` option, and pass the `song_name` argument using the `-s` option.

(For compatibility and demonstration purposes, we have limited the lyrics script to only provide lyrics to 5 songs.)

---

Step 2: In the `while` loop, right after the `GenerateRandomArtistAndSong` function is called and just before the line `echo $lyrics`, pass the `artist_name` and `song_name` variables as arguments to the `lyrics.sh` script. Save the output to a variable named `lyrics`.

Click the `Run` button when you are done.

Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/c5e8c929-9103-4b73-ad77-302b799e88f4)

Hint: 

* Use the `-a` and `-s` options to pass `$artist_name` and `$song_name` as arguments respectively to `lyrics.sh`.
* Wrap the results from the script with `$()` when you set the `lyrics` variable

The line will look like:

```yaml
lyrics=$(./lyrics.sh -a "$artist_name" -s "$song_name")
```

---

Step 3: We did it! Try out the game by running the command `./song_guesser.sh`. Feel free to play it as many times as you like.

Solution: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/33e1b320-4d9e-40d6-9d38-8502d4118ab0)

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Linux-Sandbox/assets/107522496/6308ccea-ee25-405a-b8e4-de179bfd29be)

`song_guesser.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

artist_name=""
song_name=""

# Gets random song and its respective artist from the list of songs
GenerateRandomArtistAndSong() {
  numSongs=$(cat data/lyrics.json | jq 'length')
  randomNum=$((RANDOM % $numSongs))
  song=$(jq -r --argjson num "$randomNum" '.[$num]' < data/lyrics.json)
  artist_name=$(jq -r '.artist' <<< "$song")
  song_name=$(jq -r '.song' <<< "$song")
}

echo "Welcome to the Song Guesser!"
echo "Ready to play? (y/n)"
read -r play

while [ "$play" == "y" ]  # Loop until the user answers "y"
do
  echo "Fetching lyrics..."
  echo
  sleep 3  

# Calls the function to get a random song and its respective artist
  GenerateRandomArtistAndSong 
  # Call the lyrics script to get the lyrics of the song below:
  lyrics=$(./lyrics.sh -a "$artist_name" -s "$song_name")
  
  echo "$lyrics"
  echo

  echo "Guess the name of the song or its artist"
  read -r guess
  guess=$(echo "$guess" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | xargs)  # Lowercase the guess, trim whitespaces

  # Checks if the user's guess matches the artist or song name
  if [[ "$guess" == "$song_name" || "$guess" == "$artist_name" ]]
  then
    echo "You got it!"
  else

# Review

Good job on making it through another bash scripting lesson! We have discussed how powerful bash scripts can be. Anything we can run on a Linux terminal can be run inside a script and vice versa.

Here are some main points from this lesson on bash scripting:

* Bash scripts can execute any terminal command and script. The ability to link multiple commands and reuse scripts make them a powerful tool.
* Bash scripts can automate repetitive tasks and are often used in the installation of applications and running of online services.
* *Useful scripts are plentiful on the internet. We can simply download a script and execute them with the options built-in. We can also run scripts inside of other scripts.

We have only skimmed the surface of possible applications of Bash scripts. Besides making tasks fly by, other applications for scripts include system administration, data crunching, and web application deployment.

We encourage you to practice these new scripting skills!

## `tree.sh`: 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo

# If parameter exists, use it as base folder
if [ "$1" != "" ]
   then cd "$1"
fi

pwd

# -F option: append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries
#     A '/' is a directory
#     A '*'  is executable
#     A ( '|' ) is a FIFO
#     A '@'  is a symbolic link.
# -1 option: print only one entry per line
if [ `ls -F -1 | grep "/" | wc -l` = 0 ]   # Check if no folders
   then echo "   -> no sub-directories"
fi

# ls -R print recursively
# grep ":$" filter lines with ":" at the end of a line (anchoring)
ls -R | grep ":$" | \
   sed -e 's/:$//' -e 's/[^-][^\/]*\//--/g' -e 's/^/   /' -e 's/-/|/'
# 1st sed expression: remove colons
# 2nd sed expression: replace higher level folder names with dashes
# 3rd sed expression: indent graph three spaces
# 4th sed expression: replace first dash with a vertical bar
