# Solution - Off-Platform Project: Users & Permissions in Linux

In this article, you will practice some Linux system administration skills. Youâ€™ll make sure your coworkers James, Destiny, and Carolyn each have the intended levels of access to specific files.

Welcome to this off-platform project! You will follow along with the project in your Linux Ubuntu desktop (either in VirtualBox or native). Have your Linux terminal ready!

# Environment Setup

Step 1:

Access your Linux environment, whether it is through VirtualBox or Linux running natively on your desktop. Login to your Linux environment as root or run the following command to escalate your access levels to the root: 

```
sudo -i
```

---

Step 2: Start by creating the groups for the marketing team, sales team, and the information technology team. 

```bash
groupadd marketing-team -f
groupadd sales-team -f
groupadd it-team -f
```

---

Step 3: Verify that the groups are created by listing all the available groups on your environment: 

```
cat /etc/group
```

The newly created group names must be appended at the end of the list.

---

Step 4: Then create the users.

```
useradd james -g marketing-team -m
useradd destiny -g sales-team -m
useradd carolyn -g it-team -m
adduser carolyn sudo
```

The users are promptly added to their proper groups using the `-g` option. In addition, a new `home` directory is created for each new user since the `-m` flag is enabled. 

Step 5: Observe the newly created home directories for the users:

```
ls /home/
```
