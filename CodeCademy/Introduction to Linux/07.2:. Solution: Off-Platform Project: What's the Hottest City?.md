# Solution to Project: Off-Platform Project: What's the Hottest City?

Use the weather utility from Bash-Snippets to gather and sort temperature data from multiple cities.

# Project Objectives

This project, which you’ll complete in a Linux environment, reviews the bash scripting skills you’ve learned thus far. You will be creating a bash script that:

* Fetches forecast temperatures for multiple cities.
* Saves those temperatures to a file.
* Sorts the cities based on their temperatures.

You will install and use a modified version of the `weather` bash script from [Bash-Snippets](https://github.com/alexanderepstein/Bash-Snippets) to gather the required forecast information. The `weather` script gets the location from the user and sends it to the [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/) API. The API returns a detailed weather forecast of the specified location.

# Project Setup

Even though the wttr.in API is highly customizable, the original `weather` script is not. This is why we made our own version of the `weather` command which can show a much simpler output such as: `Paris +39°F`.

# Install Modified weather Script

Let’s begin by opening up a terminal inside VirtualBox Ubuntu Desktop and:

Step 1: Download our modified `weather` script using the command

```
wget https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-linux/weather-offplatform-project/weather.sh  
```

When we run `ls`, we can see the `weather.sh` script has been downloaded.

---

Step 2:  Give it executable permissions using the command:
```
    chmod +x weather.sh
```

---

Step 3: See the usage of our script with:

```
./weather.sh -h
```

The `-h` option is for help.

Step 4: We retained the original functionality of the weather utility while adding an option, `-s`, to show a simpler output. Try out the script with and without the `-s` option. 

* With `-s` option:

* Without `-s` option

---

Step 5: You could try some of the examples below:

* `./weather.sh Tokyo`

---

* `./weather.sh -s Tokyo`

Solution:

Notice the original output is quite fancy, which makes it challenging to filter out the temperature.
