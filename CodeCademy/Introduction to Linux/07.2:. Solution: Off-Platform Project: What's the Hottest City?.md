# Solution to Project: Off-Platform Project: What's the Hottest City?

Use the weather utility from Bash-Snippets to gather and sort temperature data from multiple cities.

# Project Objectives

This project, which you’ll complete in a Linux environment, reviews the bash scripting skills you’ve learned thus far. You will be creating a bash script that:

* Fetches forecast temperatures for multiple cities.
* Saves those temperatures to a file.
* Sorts the cities based on their temperatures.

You will install and use a modified version of the `weather` bash script from [Bash-Snippets](https://github.com/alexanderepstein/Bash-Snippets) to gather the required forecast information. The `weather` script gets the location from the user and sends it to the [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/) API. The API returns a detailed weather forecast of the specified location.

---

# Project Setup

Even though the wttr.in API is highly customizable, the original `weather` script is not. This is why we made our own version of the `weather` command which can show a much simpler output such as: `Paris +39°F`.

---

# Install Modified weather Script

Let’s begin by opening up a terminal inside VirtualBox Ubuntu Desktop and:

Step 1: Download our modified `weather` script using the command

```
wget https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-linux/weather-offplatform-project/weather.sh  
```

When we run `ls`, we can see the `weather.sh` script has been downloaded.

---

Step 2:  Give it executable permissions using the command:
```
    chmod +x weather.sh
```

---

Step 3: See the usage of our script with:

```
./weather.sh -h
```

The `-h` option is for help.

---

Step 4: We retained the original functionality of the weather utility while adding an option, `-s`, to show a simpler output. Try out the script with and without the `-s` option. 

* With `-s` option:

* Without `-s` option

---

Step 5: You could try some of the examples below:

* `./weather.sh Tokyo`

---

STep 6: `./weather.sh -s Tokyo`

Notice the original output is quite fancy, which makes it challenging to filter out the temperature.

---

# Optional: Install Bash-Snippets `weather` Script

Installing the original `weather` script from Bash-Snippets is optional. However, it is recommended if you are familiar with git and if you wish to further improve on the script you will be writing in this project.

Step 7: To install the official weather script from Bash-Snippets. Enter the following commands one at a time on the terminal:

```
sudo apt -y install git
git clone https://github.com/alexanderepstein/Bash-Snippets
cd Bash-Snippets/
git checkout v1.23.0
sudo ./install.sh weather
```

Step 8: Once the `weather` script is installed, see its usage with `weather -h` and try it out!

Can see from above that my machine has Git alread installed.

Step 9: Once complete, we can verify the installation by invoking the `-h` option:

To finish the set up process, we need to create a bash script which we will be working on. 

# Create Script File

Step 10: Let’s create the shell script file you will be working with, **sortCityTemps.sh**, and give it permission to execute:

```bash
touch sortCityTemps.sh
chmod +x sortCityTemps.sh
```

You can work on this file in either the Ubuntu Desktop Editor (which comes pre-installed), a code editor of your choosing, or inside the terminal itself with nano. You can open the file in Ubuntu Desktop Editor using the command gedit sortCityTemps.sh &. If you decide to use nano, remember that you can save changes to the file using CTRL / CMD + O and exit using CTRL / CMD + X.

Add the line #!/bin/bash to the top of the script and save!
