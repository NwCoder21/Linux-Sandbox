In this lesson, we will be introducing you to a variety of Bash commands to handle specific needs such as:

* **Documentation**: the Linux shell can be a daunting place for a beginner. Thankfully it comes with a few utilities to help you out when you’re stuck or need a cheat sheet.
* **File archiving and compression**: you will no doubt come across compressed or archived files with `.zip` or `.tar` file extension. We will discuss the terminal commands used to compress, decompress, archive, and extract files.
* **Networking**: we will talk about all the basic network monitoring or accessing the Linux shell has to offer for downloading files from a destination to checking network connectivity.

Let’s get started!

# Access Documentation in Linux

Linux provides many ways to access documentation for other commands! Before we had the ability to use search engines to look up any questions we had, offline documentation was our only point of reference.

We can access documentation in the terminal itself using these files and commands:

* The `/usr/share/doc/` directory
* The `man` command
* The `info` command

## /usr/share/doc/

The /usr/share/doc/ directory contains README files, simple text files that describe a program, for many installed packages in your Linux distribution. You can explore the documentation available there using the command below.

The `/usr/share/doc/` directory contains README files, simple text files that describe a program, for many installed packages in your Linux distribution. You can explore the documentation available there using the command below.

```
ls /usr/share/doc
```

## The `man` command

The `man` command is used to access the manual pages, the traditional way of distributing documentation for all bash programs. The command

```
man [options] <command_name>
```

will give us the command’s manual page includes a brief synopsis of the program, a description that lists all options, and examples.

For example, `man cat` will display the manual page for the command `cat`. The manual pages can be rather long but don’t be alarmed. We can also browse the manual pages online.

## The `info` command

Even though manual pages are somewhat outdated, they make for great cheat sheets/reference cards. For full and detailed documentation, we can use the `info` command which also contains more recent information about programs than man. Its basic usage is:

```
info [options] <command_name>
```

For example, running `info cat` in the terminal will provide detailed information about the command `cat`.

Step 1: Use `ls` to see inside the directory `/usr/share/doc/`.

Each one of the directories you see includes READMEs, examples, changelog, and more for their respective programs.

Hint: 

```
ls /usr/share/doc/
```

---

Step 2: Open up the man page for the command `ls`. You can exit the man page at any time by pressing the `q` key.

We can scroll through the man page with the `up` and `down` arrow keys. To search a string, we can type `/`followed by the search text and press the `Enter`. We can step through the results with the `n` key.

When you quit out of the manual page, press `Enter` into a new line to complete this checkpoint!

Solution:

```
man ls
```

Hint: `man`’s syntax is as follows:

```
man [options] <command_name>
```


---

Step 3: Open up the man page for the command `man` itself. The manual page for the `man` command is a good place for a beginner to start getting familiar with manual pages. When you’re ready, press `q` to close the manual page.

You might have noticed the `MAN(1)` in the upper corners of the manual page. The number in the parenthesis refers to the manual [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#Manual_sections). Section `1` refers to general commands, `2` refers to system calls, and so on.

When you quit out of the manual page, press `Enter` into a new line to complete this checkpoint!

Hint: `man`’s syntax is as follows:

```
man [options] <command_name>
```

---

Step 4: Open up the `info` page for the command `ls`. Notice the stark difference in detail between the manual page and the info page.

The controls to browse the info pages are very similar to the manual page except you can press enter when the marker is over an underlined section to jump straight to that section. When you’re ready, press `q` to close the page.

When you quit out of the `info` page, press `Enter` into a new line to complete this checkpoint!

Solution:

```
info ls
```
