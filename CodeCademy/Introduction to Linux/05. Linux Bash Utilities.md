In this lesson, we will be introducing you to a variety of Bash commands to handle specific needs such as:

* **Documentation**: the Linux shell can be a daunting place for a beginner. Thankfully it comes with a few utilities to help you out when you’re stuck or need a cheat sheet.
* **File archiving and compression**: you will no doubt come across compressed or archived files with `.zip` or `.tar` file extension. We will discuss the terminal commands used to compress, decompress, archive, and extract files.
* **Networking**: we will talk about all the basic network monitoring or accessing the Linux shell has to offer for downloading files from a destination to checking network connectivity.

Let’s get started!

# Access Documentation in Linux

Linux provides many ways to access documentation for other commands! Before we had the ability to use search engines to look up any questions we had, offline documentation was our only point of reference.

We can access documentation in the terminal itself using these files and commands:

* The `/usr/share/doc/` directory
* The `man` command
* The `info` command

## /usr/share/doc/

The /usr/share/doc/ directory contains README files, simple text files that describe a program, for many installed packages in your Linux distribution. You can explore the documentation available there using the command below.

The `/usr/share/doc/` directory contains README files, simple text files that describe a program, for many installed packages in your Linux distribution. You can explore the documentation available there using the command below.

```
ls /usr/share/doc
```

## The `man` command

The `man` command is used to access the manual pages, the traditional way of distributing documentation for all bash programs. The command

```
man [options] <command_name>
```

will give us the command’s manual page includes a brief synopsis of the program, a description that lists all options, and examples.

For example, `man cat` will display the manual page for the command `cat`. The manual pages can be rather long but don’t be alarmed. We can also browse the manual pages online.

## The `info` command

Even though manual pages are somewhat outdated, they make for great cheat sheets/reference cards. For full and detailed documentation, we can use the `info` command which also contains more recent information about programs than man. Its basic usage is:

```
info [options] <command_name>
```

For example, running `info cat` in the terminal will provide detailed information about the command `cat`.

---

Step 1: Use `ls` to see inside the directory `/usr/share/doc/`.

Each one of the directories you see includes READMEs, examples, changelog, and more for their respective programs.

Solution:

Hint: 

```
ls /usr/share/doc/
```

---

Step 2: Open up the man page for the command `ls`. You can exit the man page at any time by pressing the `q` key.

We can scroll through the man page with the `up` and `down` arrow keys. To search a string, we can type `/`followed by the search text and press the `Enter`. We can step through the results with the `n` key.

When you quit out of the manual page, press `Enter` into a new line to complete this checkpoint!

Solution:

```
man ls
```

Hint: `man`’s syntax is as follows:

```
man [options] <command_name>
```


---

Step 3: Open up the man page for the command `man` itself. The manual page for the `man` command is a good place for a beginner to start getting familiar with manual pages. When you’re ready, press `q` to close the manual page.

You might have noticed the `MAN(1)` in the upper corners of the manual page. The number in the parenthesis refers to the manual [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#Manual_sections). Section `1` refers to general commands, `2` refers to system calls, and so on.

When you quit out of the manual page, press `Enter` into a new line to complete this checkpoint!

Hint: `man`’s syntax is as follows:

```
man [options] <command_name>
```

---

Step 4: Open up the `info` page for the command `ls`. Notice the stark difference in detail between the manual page and the info page.

The controls to browse the info pages are very similar to the manual page except you can press enter when the marker is over an underlined section to jump straight to that section. When you’re ready, press `q` to close the page.

When you quit out of the `info` page, press `Enter` into a new line to complete this checkpoint!

Solution:

```
info ls
```

Hint: `info`’s syntax is as follows:

```
info [options] <command_name>
```

# Compression Utilities

Chances are you’ve come across archived or compressed files and downloaded them. To interact with them through the command line, the Linux shell comes standard with many [compression / decompression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression) and [archive / extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_file) commands.

Let’s first talk about the compression commands which reduce file sizes and [differ mainly by the algorithms](https://linuxreviews.org/Comparison_of_Compression_Algorithms) behind them. Three popular compression commands are:

* `gzip`: retains the original file’s ownership modes, access, and modification timestamps. Compressed files have the `.gz` extension.
* `bzip2`: compressed files have the `.bz2` extension.
* `xz`: compressed files have the `.xz` extension.

The syntax to compress a file using one of these compression utilities is:

```
<compression_utility> [options] <file_name>
```

For example, the command `gzip hello.txt` will result in a compressed file named `hello.txt.gz` and delete the original file. Adding the `-k` option will retain the original file.

Multiple files can be compressed by adding all of their names as arguments or by using the wildcard symbol (`*`). For example:

```
bzip2 poem.txt riddle.txt
```

will result in two compressed files: `poem.txt.bz2` and `riddle.txt.bz2` whereas

```
xz *.txt
```

would compress all files in the current directory with the `.txt` extension.

The `gzip` command has the ability to compress all files in a directory using the `-r` option and providing the path to a directory.

Files can be decompressed using the `-d` option.

Note: For more information and options, you can refer to the manual or info pages for these commands or use the `--help` option for each command.

In the next exercise, we will learn about the popular archive utilities available on the Linux shell: `zip` and `tar`.

Hint: We can compress multiple files with `bzip2` using

```
bzip2 <file1> <file2> <file3> ..
```

OR

```
bzip2 *.<file_extension>
```

---

Step 4: Compress the file **codecademy.png** with `xz` using the `-k` option.

Solution:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Azure/assets/107522496/738f659c-0530-4bb8-bd91-bfc266b29d61)

Hint: We can compress a file with xz using

```
xz [options] <file_name>
```

OR

```
xz <file_name> [options]
```

---

Step 5: Using `bzip2` and the `-d` option, decompress all the files `.bz2` files inside the directory `riddles`.

To refer to the files, you can use the path `riddles/*.bz2`!

Solution:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Azure/assets/107522496/e2bf37d1-47c3-4fc1-a960-64ed70510434)

Hint: Notice that the files are all compressed using `bzip2` since their extension is `.bz2`. To decompress all `.bz2` files in a directory, use

```
bzip2 -d <directory>/*.bz2
```

---

Step 6: Now, compress all the files in the `riddles` directory using `gzip` with the `-r` option.

Solution:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Azure/assets/107522496/10540102-d5d0-4491-9261-bada09aef3d3)

Hint: We can compress all files in a directory with `gzip` using

```
gzip -r <directory>
```

---

Step 7: Run the command `ls -R` again to see the resulting files.

Solution:

# Archive Utilities

Archiving allows us to consolidate multiple files or directories into a single [archived file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_file). Two of the popular archive commands on Linux, `zip` and `tar`, have the ability to compress and archive files. This means that unlike the compression commands which compress a single file at a time, the files’ size will be reduced and packaged into a single archive file in one command.

## `zip`

Zip files are very popular across multiple operating systems. We can create a `.zip` archive like so:

```
zip <archive_name>.zip <file1> <file2> …
```

Note: On some distributions of Linux, `zip` must first be installed using the command `sudo apt install zip unzip`.

Directories can be easily archived with the `-r` option. Archived files can be extracted and decompressed using the `unzip` command and providing paths to one or more `.zipfiles`. 

## `tar`

`tar`, which stands for tape archive or tarball, is a very important archiving utility for Linux systems. While a `zip` archive is more popular across platforms, it is recommended to use `tar` when distributing archives among Linux-based systems. This is because `tar` archives store Unix file attributes, retaining file permissions and other metadata.

```
tar -cf <archive_name>.tar <files or directories>
```

creates an uncompressed `.tar` archive. A `.tar` file can be referred to as a tarball.

For example,

```
tar -cf example.tar index.html script.js style.css
```

will create a `.tar` archive file with three files: `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css`.

To extract the files in a `.tar` archive, we can use the `-xf` option.

```
tar -xf <archive_name>.tar
```

In the next exercise, we will learn how to further compress `.tar` files.
