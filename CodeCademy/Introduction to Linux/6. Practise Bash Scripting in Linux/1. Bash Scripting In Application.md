# Print Directory Structure Script I

Let’s work on a basic script that prints a directory structure in a tree format, which is useful for viewing nested subdirectories. The script takes advantage of the powerful commands that the Linux shell provides for file and folder operations.

We will be using conditional statements as well as the following commands:

* `echo`
* `cd`
* `pwd`
* `ls`
* `grep`
* `sed`
* `wc`

This script will take in an optional string argument: the parent directory that should be the starting point for the tree. If this is not provided, we will use the current working directory. We will print a message if the parent directory has no subfolders to print. If we find there are subfolders to print, we’ll use a combination of the commands `ls`, `grep`, and `sed` to print the directory structure tree.

We will be working on the script named `tree.sh`, which is already opened in the editor.

# Instructions

Step 1: Let’s begin by checking the `tree.sh` script to see if an input argument was provided. If so, we should change the current working directory to that argument.

In the code editor, where there’s a comment in the file, add a conditional statement that:

* Checks if `$1` was not equal to an empty string `""`
* If so, the script should `cd` to `$1`

Remember to use quotes around `$1`!

Click the `Run` button when you are done.

Step 2:

After the conditional statement, use the `pwd` command to print out the current working directory.

Step 3: Next, use the following in a conditional statement to check if no subdirectories exist under the parent directory.

```yaml
`ls -F -1 | grep "/" | wc -l` = 0
```

The logic behind this statement is:

The provided conditional statement uses `ls` lists files and directories with indicators one line at a time. `grep` is then used to find the `/` indicator which implies a directory. If the line count calculated by `wc -l` is `0`, then no subdirectories exist.

If the above statement is true, use `echo` to print `"-> no sub-directories"`.
