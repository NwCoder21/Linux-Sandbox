# Positional Parameters, Arguments, for Loops, Special Parameter 

This lessons continues with positional parameters, and will also cover how to create a while loop.

Will name this script `luser-demo06.sh`

Will then start the bash script with the shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) and write  a comment outlining the purpose of this script.

# Display the first three parameters 

In the last lesson, we learnt that the first positional parameter of `${0}` contains the name of the script itself, while `${1}` stores the value of the first argument pass to the script on the command line. `${2}` stores the second argument and so on.

We never actually used `${1}` and onwards directly in that lesson, so let's do that now and see how they work and how they behave in different situations.

The last `echo` statement will print a blank line.

Save the script and grant it executable permissions.

Here, have run the script with no arguments, this means there are no values to store inside the script as positional parameters with the exception of `${0}`. This is the very first positional parameter and contains the name of the script itself.

Now we have passed in a parameter 'pear'. This means `${1}` is assigned the value of `pear`.

So this is how we access the arguements within the script, i.e, by using postional parameters.

If we were to add more command line arguments, for example, another word here, let's say 'newspaper', then that is stored in `${4}` but we didn't account for a user entering `${4}`. This can present an issue because we don't know exactly how many arguments a user may input. This is why use for loops and while loops to handle command line arguments.

---

Next in our script we want to loop through all the positional parameters. In the previous lesson, we used a For Loop to do that, but this time we will use a While Loop.

So, first, let's take a look what type a While Loop is using `type -a while`. We can see that it is a shell keyword/shell built-in. This means we can use `help` against this command for more information on it. Type `help while`.

`"Execute commands as long as a test succeeds.

Expand and execute COMMANDS as long as the final command in the `while` COMMANDS has an exit status of zero."`: 

You can think of this as being `while true, Do.` in other words, while the condition that is being tested for is true, then the commands will execute.

This means that during the while loop, we will want to change the thing being tested for in some way so that the condition eventually evaluates to false. Otherwise, we will end up endin an infinite loop.

---

Now let's create a While Loop on the command line...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209128297-8e09ee40-aef4-401a-8c01-3428fe5410f1.png)

Here, we are using a variable called `X` and will assign it a value of 1. 

`"${X}" -eq 1` is a conditional expression and we are testing to see if `${X}` is equal to one.

If this is true, then we will `echo "The value of X is: ${X}"`
`X=5` here, we are manipulating the value of X so this does not becomen infinite loop. 


So, thw while loop runs and checks if X is equal to 1. If this is true, and it is on the first loop, it then prints out the echo statement. X is then changed to 5. The While Loop runs again and checks if X is equal to 1. This time this is false, so the While Loop does not run the echo statement again and the While Loop exits.

This While Loop demonstrates changing a variable that is being tested against in the conditional expression of the while loop.

If the conditional expression never evaluates to true, then the commands in the While Loop will never get executed.

---

Let's create an infinite loop and see how we can break out of it, but first, let's introduce the `true` command. Its only job is to return an exit status of true.
