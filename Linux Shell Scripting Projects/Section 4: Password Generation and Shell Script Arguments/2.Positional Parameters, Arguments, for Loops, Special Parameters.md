Will create a script called lusers-demo06.sh

---

# `#!/bin/bash`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207849081-3c6a85d7-4691-4d6f-8441-9f110969d3b0.png)

As always, we need to start each script with a shebang (`#!/bin/bash`).

Have also included the objective of this script.

---

# Display what the user typed on the command line

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207850370-ca86c573-eb76-43a7-be08-eda57f663c56.png)

The variable `${0}` is actually a positional parameter, and positional parameters are variables that contain the contents of the command line.

---

# Difference between an argument and positional parameter 

A parameter is a variable that is being used inside the shell script. An argument is the data passed into the shell script. So an argument which is supplied on the command line, becomes the value stored in a parameter.

With this in mind, the very first positional parameter is `${0}`, which contains the name of the script itseWe lf. We can think of this as being what the person typed in the command line to execute the script.

The next positional parameter is `${1}`, which stores the value of the first argument passed to the script when running it on the command line.

The positional parameter `${2}` stores the second argument. `${3}` stores the third argument and so on.

Now let's look at the output of our script so far: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207851864-21b3b7fc-21e5-44e0-b89f-b0c53b44c3d9.png)

When we run this script, `${0}` expands to how we executed the script, `/home/tuser/myscripts/lusers-demo06.sh`.

---

<!-- 3:27 -->

# `PATH` variable 

The command search path is stored in the environment variable `PATH`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207852800-476cee9e-ec63-451e-afaa-72ae274b8fef.png)

If a command is not a function or a shell built in, then Bash will look for that command first in the above folders, in the sam order they are listed. 

`PATH` can be changed so no guarantee that it will be the same for every user across every system.

If you want to control the path, you can do so in your script by manipulating the `${path}` variable there.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207853645-a70b6daa-d957-4937-9851-2a15f4cb34d9.png)

To see what command will be executed, we can use the `which` command. For example, in the above screenshot, we are checking what command will be executed when we run `head`. In this case, it is `/usr/bin/head`.

<!-- Go over from 3:27 till 8:47  -->

---

# `basname` 

The `basename` command removes the directory component and just returns the file name. Let's check its man page:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207855111-89031af3-1530-4571-807e-dd3e724db316.png)

We can see that: "basename - strip directory and suffix from filenames"

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207856930-20027f2c-48ce-4d2b-b671-8ee2dff47532.png)

Now when we run our script, it only outputs the file/script we are running and not the whole path.

---

`basename` does not do any smart checking to see if the file exists. It just strips off the directory portion of a string that is passed to it so, we can even give a `basename` something that clearly doesn't exist, but it will still do its job. For example: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207857364-4064242a-9c16-4267-86d2-af687f2adb25.png)

We an prove that this file does not exist by using ls /directory/file. When run, it says no such file or directory.

---

# `dirname`

This is the opposite of `basename`. This takes off the last component from a file name:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207857720-945e48f0-d8cb-4fa8-b11f-5e736c39d5f8.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207858308-d607e40b-46b7-4753-87b8-df4006aca09f.png)

From this we can see that `dirname` strips off the file name and only outputs the rest of the path.

---

Like `basename`, `dirname` does not do any smart checking. We can give it a non existent path and it will simply return the portion that looks like the directory. For example: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207858783-ac56581f-8898-413f-9ca3-31401cafd3bc.png)

This whole path does not exist, but `dirname` doesn't check, rather, it just returns the directory of the file.

---

Now let's use both of these commands in our script.

---

# Display the path and filename of the script

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207859598-c9633283-98e0-4ff0-8123-28183df7201e.png)

In previous lessons,we used a `$` followed by a command that was wrapped in parentheses to assign the output of that command to a variable that is called **command substitution**. For example:

```bash
# Display Username
USERNAME=$(id -un)
```

In this case, we are only going to use the output of each of these commands once, so we just included them right in the echo command.

Again, what this `$(<command>)` syntax does or this **command substitution** syntax does, is return the output of the command. You can assign the output to a variable or use that output without assigning it to a variable. Either way is fine.

You don't have to use **command substitution ** and **variable assignment** only you can use it in line as well.

---
Now let's run our script:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207874632-dbcf9f87-e9e9-44e2-a07a-5da8e69a7c26.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207874501-d7157990-8f46-4d3e-8f47-fa5c1016af1f.png)

This is what we get. The first output displays the path and the actual file name itself, whereas the second output displays the path separately (using `dirname`), and the file separately (using `basename`).

---

# Special Parameter

Let's take a look at the man page for bash, `man bash` and search for `/Special Parameter`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207881890-5279297d-0200-4c33-a8cc-a858caa95fab.png)

For `#` we can se that it says `$#` tells us how many arguments were supplied on the command line.

---

# Tell the user how many arguments they passed in.

Back to our script: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207882645-d3947e85-26af-4044-b6a6-71fdb6408e35.png)

Remember, we can use either `NUM_OF_PARAMETERS="$#"` or `NUM_OF_PARAMETERS="${#}"`. Don't have to use `{}`.

Let's save changes and run script.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207883942-5a710fa5-07af-42dd-acdc-cf3c65b51bd2.png)

It says we have provided 0 arguments. Let's provide it with an argument:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207884280-9f82da67-9cad-4279-a9d5-4eff2ed89442.png)

We can see that it accurately tells us the amount of arguments we provided. This means the `$#` must be working. 

---

# Make sure that user supplies at least one argument.

The aim of this script is to generate a random password for each user that supplied on the command line. So, We want to make sure that at least one user is supplied on the command line.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207889167-9cab1188-3511-4d79-b5c2-58819fba3b69.png)

`"${NUM_OF_PARAMETERS}"`: When we use a variable in between brackets here, we're going to enclose it in quotation marks.

`echo "Usage: ${0} USER_NAME [USER_NAME]..."`: So if the number of parameters is less than one, then what we're going to do is echo a usage statement. Instead of manually typing in the name of the script, we can just simply use dollar sign zero to echo back more or less what the user typed in at the command line, and then we'll tell them what they need to do. They need to supply a username (`USER_NAME`) and optionally they can supply another username (`[USER_NAME]`) and actually optionally they can supply even more username (`...`).

`exit 1`: If user reaches this point, it means that the script did not successfully execute because they didn't give us any people to create passwords for. So, what we're going to do is exit with the non zero exit 

> Note: could also have said 

```bash
if [[ "${NUMBER_OF_PARAMETERS}" -eq 0 ]]
```
.... Both ways will work. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208063398-59da54fe-75c8-4caa-b864-f1e8cdb591c0.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208063342-80311e98-551f-4760-865d-94fb0a741bf6.png)

If we run our script now, we can see that, because we did not use any argments, we got the usage statement.

In other words, instead of this usage statement, we can write something like "You have supllied no username/s, please run this script again with at least one username."

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208063710-9c599d94-ab6f-4714-9e10-7cfcd80215c7.png)

We can also check the exit status code using `echo ${?}`. We can see that it says 1 for the exit status code which means the script was not comleted successfully all the way.

---

Now let's try running our script by also giving it arguements:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208064101-162af28e-ca48-4abc-8973-6e8ed99cb30d.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208064246-9d2788e2-5d3c-42a8-9adc-cae16169a698.png)

Because in the above screenshot, `how are you` is enclosed in quotation marks, it is regarded as one argument. Can also use single quotation marks, such as:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208064609-bcaa1ccc-a089-4444-80c3-a76a7c2fd333.png)

---

# For Loops

The aim of this scriptis to perform the same action over a list of items.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208064883-f2ebccf6-3b27-4734-9e53-6cdc8375bd05.png)

Using `type -a`, we can see that `for` is a shell built-in. This means to get more information on it, we can use `help`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208065361-a456fc2d-ee60-4591-8f39-2e5eee02826a.png)

---

`for: for NAME [in WORDS ... ] ; do COMMANDS; done`

The name you see in the help here is actually a variable name for each item in the list of words the variable name is set to that item. Then the commands are executed and the process is repeated for each item in the list.

---

Let's first create a For Loop in the commmand line:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208077949-256faec0-7e3f-42bd-862b-0e8c87a30b1f.png)

In this example, `i` is first assigned to Joe, then the `echo` command gets executed using that variable in ${i}.
Then the next time the loop repeats. Harry is assigned to `i`, the commands executes and finally Rebecca is assigned to `i` and the commands executes.

>  We close the For Lopp with `done`.


---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208078424-3b1df0a9-ece4-420a-a391-23a7d033e156.png)

We can also writ the loop on one line using `;`s. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208078615-32430646-e346-44fb-8b79-6d4770c32618.png)

We will get the same result.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208078859-2f81fd49-4c8e-4801-908e-4b279514212e.png)
On the for help page, it also says:

"If `in WORDS ...;' is not present, then `in "$@"' is assumed"

So, let's find out what `$@` measn. To do this, let's look at the bash man page using `man bash`. Search for `/Special Parameters`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208079363-62525d78-1d78-4116-b06d-84a52568f0bc.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208079634-f4cefbb9-e0ce-496c-a797-6f1443d948a9.png)

From the text highlighted in blue in the above two screenshots, we can see that the `@` sign special parameter. 

"It expands the positional parameters starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word. That is, "$@" is equivalent to "$@1", "$@2" and so on."

Now this is nearly the same as `$*`. For `*` sign special parameter, whihc also:

"Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one." However, if it's enclosed in double quotes, it expands to a single word.

**We don't want to treat all the parameters as a single word, rather, we want is a list of words as they were supplied on the command line.**

That's why we're going to use `$@` and not `$*` in our script.


This is because, we can't know exactly how many positional parameters a user will attempt to supply at the command line. We can check for them, but we just don't know in advance. So instead of generating a password for `$1`, `$2`, `$3` and so on, even though they may only supply two arguments, for example, then what we're going to do is use `$@`

So, no matter how many arguments they pass into the script, it is covered by `$@`

So we don't have to guess what the user is going to do.

Now let's go back to editing the script.

---

 # Generate and display a password for each parameter.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208083370-2b7a236b-4114-496c-8c4e-893e2a3d4092.png)

For this will use a For Loop. 

`USER_NAME` : We will supply a variable name called USER_NAME 

`PASSWORD=$(date +%s%N | sha256sum | head -c10)`: So we're going to use the command we used to generate passwords in the previous script.

Now let's test our script.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208083422-5ca50329-3eca-4bd7-b708-10ce50df0908.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208083098-dca9a975-54c6-422b-ac2c-24e8d32fc951.png)

We can see that the For Loop executed once as we only provided one argument, generated a password and diplayed it to the user.  

---  

Now let's try adding multiple arguments:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208084439-3145aa26-68fb-4ce9-9863-e07e06da3830.png)

So by using the For Loop in conjunction with `${@}` we were able to account for everything passed in on the command line.

---

# Difference between `${@}` and `${*}`

To see the dfference between `${@}` and `${*}`, let's change the script. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208084656-41f524f8-ff17-4d6f-b8ad-18d2c9d4b03d.png)

Here, we will change the `${@}` to a `${*}`, so now it looks like: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208084864-f304f95b-e60d-43d0-9f28-b21318ce5228.png)

Let's save changes and run the script again:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208085025-4a672d1e-ca2c-4643-835f-97b3ccc5572f.png)

With the update, we can see it treated everything on the command line as one argument. So the for loop only ran one time and generated a password for that one argument.

Now change the script back to `${@}`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208085320-402ae183-d004-46c8-bb95-87fa4103dcb5.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208085500-9361b39a-4fc9-43a9-a86c-5ca96670b633.png)

Can see now it is working as required and gives each arguement a passsword using the For Loop.

---

# Recap

We learnt about:

* positional parameters 
* That `${0}` expands to the name of the shell script
* That `${1}` expands to the first argument supplied on the commmand line, `${2}` expands to the second argument supplied on the commmand line, `${3}` expands to the third argument supplied on the commmand line and so on..
* special Positional Parameters:
 1. `${#}`: this represents the number of parameters/arguments
 2. `${*}`: this expands to the list of positional parameters starting at `${1}`
 3. `${@}`: also expands to the list of positional parameters starting at `${1}`. However, the difference between `${@}` and `${*}` is only noticed when enclosing them in quotation marks. That difference is that `${*}` treats all the positional parameters as one string and `${@}` treats them as separate words.
* `PATH` variable: used to store a list of colon separated directories that make up the command search path.
* `which` command
* `basename` command
* `dirname` command 
* How to create a for loop both at the command line as well as in a script.
