# Case Statements

In this lesson, we will learn how to use the case statement. The case statement is a good way to make a decision based on the value of a given variable. This is especially true when you have a specific set of values that you're looking for.

Up until now, we have been using the IF statement to perform tests and make decisions in our scripts. Now, we are going to learn how to make decisions using the case statement.

# Looking at the Case Command

First, let's look at the `case` command. If we type `type -a case`, we will see that it is a shell built-in. 

Because it is a shell built in, we know that we can get some information on how to use it with the `help` built-in command.

The first line shows us the syntax of how to use the case statement.

Also, this output tells us that commands will be executed based on pattern matching. So what you do with a case statement is compare a value to a pattern, and if the value matches that pattern, the commands associated with that pattern or below that pattern get executed. If the pattern isn't matched, nothing gets executed again.

# Naming Our Script

I will name this lesson's script `luser-demo09.sh`.

Then start the script with a SHEBANG and a brief command of what the script woll do.

# IF Statement

First we will use an `if` statement and then look at how we can use a case statement which improves our if statement. 

---

Moving on, let's say we want to do something if the word `start` was passed in as the first argument into our shell script. We know that the first argument is stored in `${1}`. So, we can do:

```yaml
if [[ "${1}" = 'start' ]]
then
 echo 'Starting.'
```
