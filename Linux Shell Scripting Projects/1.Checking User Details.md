When you run the script so far, this is what happens ..

> Note: the UID of 0 is always assigned to the root user on every Linux system 

---
## Side Note 

To see where this UID comes from, let's have a look at the bash man page. 

Note: to search the bash man page, type `man bash`
To search for something in vim is by typing / {and the text you are looking for}
To search for next instance, enter `n`

# Displaying username 


Next step is to display username. Can use the `id` command with the `-un` options

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/201333283-55a0995a-8905-4ca3-adcd-ec16efbe2a75.png)

When looking up the `id`command, can type in terminal `type -a id`. Some of what you will see is: 

-n, --name  <br />
    print a name instead of a number  <br />
-u, --user  <br />
    print only the effective user ID  <br />
              
`id` on its own will only print out a number for the user. To output the id as a name, use the `-un` options.

> Note: order of options does not matter, such as:

# `whoami`

Another option is to use the whoami to display the username. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/201333891-487cdab2-6dd2-4e82-9ce4-9b0a80da111e.png)

To check what type of command `whoami` is, we can use `type -a whoami`

From the above, we can see that it is a program, so can use `man` command on it to see more details about it:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/201334048-5e2a644e-1153-4177-b4b5-5746e79b9497.png)

Where it says `[OPTION] …` means an option can also be used with the whoami command and the `…` means multiple options can be used with it.

If want to store the output of a command, we use the syntax:

```yaml
Variable_name=$(name_of_command)
```
`Variable name` > `dollar sign` > `equals sign` > `(` > `command` > `)` 

This will mean, the value of the variable `USERNAME` will equal to the output of `id -un`

---

When we run the below script:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/201334257-abcf6e40-ef44-4dc6-a01a-d847dfc04ab7.png)

Will output:

---

Another, older, syntax to assign USERNAME would be:
```yaml
USERNAME=`id -un`
```
However, this is not commonly used nowadays.

# Display is user is the root user or not 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/201334722-61f0488d-1655-4472-9f93-7d8c0d33ddb3.png)

`if [[ "${UID}" -eq 0 ]]`

Whenever use variables inside of double brackets, `[]`, close them in quotation marks, `””`. 

The syntax of:

```yaml
[[ … ]]
```

Either returns 0 for true, or 1 for false.

To find out more about if statement, type in terminal enter `type -a if`

Can see it is a shell keyword, so, for  more help, enter `help if`

The `;`, semicolon, is a command separator. Another command separator is pressing enter or begin on new line.
By pressing enter and starting a new line, it means it is easier to read, but also correct to use semicolon and keep everything on one line

---

> Note: older way to write a conditional expression is by placing the expression between sign square brackets, such as: 
`[ … ]`  

---

When running the script as root (by using sudo or su) 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/201335151-e5ad114a-32c3-4aaa-8be7-05ffa911a692.png)

We can now see that the user is now root.

# Final Look at Script 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/201337614-ecef4ea8-905c-47bd-aecf-9d45a9d5e667.png)

# Code

```bash

#!/bin/bash

# This scripts displays the User ID and username of the user executing this script 
# Display if the user is the root user or not


# Display User ID
echo "Your User ID is ${UID}"

# Display Username
USERNAME=$(id -un)
echo "Your username is ${USERNAME}"

# Display if the user is the root user or not
if [[ "${UID}" -eq 0 ]]
then
        echo "You are root user."
else
        echo "You are not root user."
fi
```
