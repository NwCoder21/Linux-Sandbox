 The scenario:

The Help Desk in our scenario has been using your script and they notice that there are some extra output that they don't need. It really doesn't make any sense to them. So they want you to make that output disappear.

We know that this output comes from the `passwd` command and that we're going to have to use IO redirection to redirect that output to the null device.

Let's look at just the couple of changes that we're going to make with this script.

* So we're going to change the name of the script from `add-new-local-user` to `add-newer-local-user`.
* We still want to make sure that the scriptis run with superuser privlieges, however, now, when displaying some help, or an error message when they don't run it with superuser privlieges, then what we want to do is send that output to standard error instead of standard output like we've been doing previously. And we will do this for all the error statuses that we're going to display in our script.

Here, using `add-new-local-user.sh add-newer-local-user.sh`, I have copied the previous script we wrote and gave it the newer name. 

So, if I now go into the script using `vim add-newer-local-user.sh `, we will see:

The previous script is already there.
