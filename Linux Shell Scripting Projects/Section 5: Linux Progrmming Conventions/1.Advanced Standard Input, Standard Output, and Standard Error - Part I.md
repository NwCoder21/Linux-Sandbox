# Advanced Standard Input, Standard Output, and Standard Error - Part I

In this section, we will be covering the different types of input and output and how to 
redirect and control those types of input and output.

We will call this script `luser-demo08.sh`.

Then we will add the Shebang to the start of the script and give a path to the bash executable and add a header to the script 
detailing what the main objective of this script it.

So far, the only type of input and output redirection that we have used has been in the 
form of a pipe. We have already written scripts that redirect the standard output from one command and send it 
as standard input into another by separating those commands with a pipe.

We have used this method to string together several commands in order to generate a random password. We also then used a pipe to send that random password to the `passwd` command.

# Different Types of Input and Output

Let's first look at the different types of input and output. There are three types of I/O (Input and Output):

* Standard Input
* Standard Output
* Standard Error 

---

By default, Standard Input comes from the keyboard. For example, the `read` command accepts standard input and you use the `read` command to collect information from a user typing something in using their keyboard.

However, Standard Input does not have to come from a keyboard. An example of this is using pipes to take the output generated by one command and use that as the standard input for another command.

---

Moving on to Standard Ouput and Standard Error, by default, both of these are displayed to the screen.

Let's start the script by redirecting the standard output of a command into a file, and you can do that by using the `>` symbol.

> NOTE: ou'll often see Standard Out abbreviated as stdout.

# Redirecting STDOUT to a file

We're going to be using a file several times throughout this script, so I'm just going to assign that file name to a variable.

We wil call that variable `FILE` and then I'm going to say that that file is going to live in  
`/tmp/data` and we'll call the name of that file data.

We'll use the `head` command, with `-n1` which will output the very first line of a file, to look at the `/etc/passwd` file and we will send the Standard Output of this command into `{FILE}`.

---

Remember, by default, Standard Output is displayed to the screen, but because we are using the `>` symbol after the command, it is redirecting that output away from the screen and into the file we specified after the greater than sign.

Now let's see what happens when we actually execute this script.

To do this, save your changes and make the script executable.

As we can see, no output was generated when we ran this script.
