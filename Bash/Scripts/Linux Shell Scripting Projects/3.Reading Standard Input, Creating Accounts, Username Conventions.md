# 3. Reading Standard Input, Creating Accounts, Username Conventions

In this lesson will learn how to take inout from user executing the script and how to create an account in a Linux system.


Will call this script luser-demo04.sh

I firstly will set out the goals of this script at the top of it and the different sections needed to get there.

---

up until now, have created scripts which can be executed on their own without external input/interaction with the person executing the script.

However, sometimes a script needs information from the user in order that the script can do something meaningful.
SO, in this script, it will ask the person running it to supply a username and password for the account and then the script will go ahead and create that account.

---

One way to get input from useris to use the read shell built-in command. Another way to get input from a user is to have them supply information on the command line as arguments to your script.

Because `read` is a shell built-in, we can use the `help` command to see more information on it. Will pipe it into less as otherwise will go all the way to the end.

There are three default types of input and output.

1. standard input
2. standard output
3. standard error 

By default, standard input comes from the keyboard and standard output and standard error are displayed to the screen.

Said "by default", as sometimes standard input does not always have to come from the keyboard, but typically that's where standard input comes from.

Can use `-p` option followed by a string which will act as a prompt 

For example, 

```yaml 
$ read -p 'Enter your name: ' THING
```

Have left a space after the `:` so that the user doesnot start straight after the prompt, rather, so that there is one space  between them.

The `THING` name is the nameof the variable which will hold whatever the user enters.

In the aove example, whatever the user enters using standard input (via keyboard) will be stored into the NAME variable.

This is how we will use read shell built-in command in our script.

This will take the user's inout and assign it to the variable USER_NAME.

Will use the same technique for the real name.

We are going to store this standard input into the PASSWORD variable.

---

At this point in the script, we've gathered all the information from the person executing the script in order to be able to create an account.

Now let's look at the `useradd` command on the command line terminal which we will use to create an account.

# LOGIN

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203346958-66fc193c-ade9-4fe8-9465-e23678e3df40.png)

Here we can see under the synopsis that useradd is followed by options (which are optional, and we know this because of it says options in between a pair of square brackets) and a has a LOGIN at the end of the command.
We know LOGIN is required because it is not in brackets

The word `login` and `username `are the same thing. 
Here in the documentation, they're using the term `login`, but when we are writing scripts, we use the term `username`.
`LOGIN` and `username` have some rules:

1.	Eight characters or less by convention - not a hard rule, but that's typically a convention or a practice that is followed.
The reason why 8 is because Linux is modelled on Unix systems, which used to have a maximum length of 8

---

Let's create a username whcih is more than 8 chracters in the shell terminal and see what happens 

> In order to add users to a system,  need to use super user privileges. And one way we can do that is with a `sudo` command. So we'll do `sudo useradd`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203349739-aa6f67b5-2004-497c-ae82-d4a8a10d143b.png)

Ths will create a user called `mjones`.

---

To switch to that user, we use `sudo su` command. `su` command allows us to switch to a different user and execute one or more commands in the shell without logging out from our current session  

`su -` and `su -l` are used to start with an environment similar to that of a real log in.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203354307-59b3403d-bd0e-4e21-a4eb-59f154f74bd2.png)

Now that we are logged in as markjones, if we run the `ps-ef` and scroll to the bottom, we can see that it only displays the first 8 characters:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203355316-6d4de7cd-1e98-4695-adbe-aa2843006595.png)

if it is longer than 8, we will see 7 characters and then `+` to represent the rest of the name.  

So again, it's not something that's going to break anything if you have a nine character or a ten character or a 20 character username, it's just something to be aware of that some of these commands, such as `ps`, are going to give you a little bit different output because historically usernames were limited to eight characters.
