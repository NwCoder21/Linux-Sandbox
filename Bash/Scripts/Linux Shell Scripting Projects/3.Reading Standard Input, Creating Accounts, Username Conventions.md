# 3. Reading Standard Input, Creating Accounts, Username Conventions

In this lesson will learn how to take inout from user executing the script and how to create an account in a Linux system.


Will call this script luser-demo04.sh

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203334771-e897e20c-ffc8-4936-abf0-4d4987279ccf.png)

I firstly will set out the goals of this script at the top of it and the different sections needed to get there.

---

up until now, have created scripts which can be executed on their own without external input/interaction with the person executing the script.

However, sometimes a script needs information from the user in order that the script can do something meaningful.
SO, in this script, it will ask the person running it to supply a username and password for the account and then the script will go ahead and create that account.

---

One way to get input from useris to use the read shell built-in command. Another way to get input from a user is to have them supply information on the command line as arguments to your script.

Because `read` is a shell built-in, we can use the `help` command to see more information on it. Will pipe it into less as otherwise will go all the way to the end.

There are three default types of input and output.

1. standard input
2. standard output
3. standard error 

By default, standard input comes from the keyboard and standard output and standard error are displayed to the screen.

Said "by default", as sometimes standard input does not always have to come from the keyboard, but typically that's where standard input comes from.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203339231-2fb3d819-6358-4678-8e53-cc073f3e8720.png)

Can use `-p` option followed by a string which will act as a prompt 

For example, 

```yaml 
$ read -p 'Enter your name: ' THING
```

Have left a space after the `:` so that the user doesnot start straight after the prompt, rather, so that there is one space  between them.

The `THING` name is the nameof the variable which will hold whatever the user enters.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203341164-d39f5919-4cc3-4a09-9ec5-7787dd6fcd66.png)

In the aove example, whatever the user enters using standard input (via keyboard) will be stored into the NAME variable.

This is how we will use read shell built-in command in our script.

This will take the user's inout and assign it to the variable USER_NAME.

---

Will use the same technique for the real name.

We are going to store this standard input into the PASSWORD variable.

---

At this point in the script, we've gathered all the information from the person executing the script in order to be able to create an account.

Now let's look at the `useradd` command on the command line terminal which we will use to create an account.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203343171-248e011e-b08c-4358-b739-17482e99b77e.png)

# LOGIN

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203346958-66fc193c-ade9-4fe8-9465-e23678e3df40.png)

Here we can see under the synopsis that useradd is followed by options (which are optional, and we know this because of it says options in between a pair of square brackets) and a has a LOGIN at the end of the command.
We know LOGIN is required because it is not in brackets

The word `login` and `username `are the same thing. 
Here in the documentation, they're using the term `login`, but when we are writing scripts, we use the term `username`.
`LOGIN` and `username` have some rules:

1.	Eight characters or less by convention - not a hard rule, but that's typically a convention or a practice that is followed.
The reason why 8 is because Linux is modelled on Unix systems, which used to have a maximum length of 8

---

Let's create a username whcih is more than 8 chracters in the shell terminal and see what happens 

> In order to add users to a system,  need to use super user privileges. And one way we can do that is with a `sudo` command. So we'll do `sudo useradd`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203349739-aa6f67b5-2004-497c-ae82-d4a8a10d143b.png)

Ths will create a user called `mjones`.

---

To switch to that user, we use `sudo su` command. `su` command allows us to switch to a different user and execute one or more commands in the shell without logging out from our current session.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203357825-4e49db8f-28d2-440a-9a08-d39fbd425592.png)


> `su -` and `su -l` are used to start with an environment similar to that of a real log in.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203354307-59b3403d-bd0e-4e21-a4eb-59f154f74bd2.png)

Now that we are logged in as markjones, if we run the `ps-ef` and scroll to the bottom, we can see that it only displays the first 8 characters:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203355316-6d4de7cd-1e98-4695-adbe-aa2843006595.png)

if it is longer than 8, we will see 7 characters and then `+` to represent the rest of the name.  

So again, it's not something that's going to break anything if you have a nine character or a ten character or a 20 character username, it's just something to be aware of that some of these commands, such as `ps`, are going to give you a little bit different output because historically usernames were limited to eight characters.

To logout of this user, use the `exit` command.

---

2. Usernames are case sensitive. so Markjones is not the same user as markjones. It is also good practise to ensure usernames are all lowercase.  
3. Can't include any special characters in your username. However, you can use numbers. For example, if you're creating accounts using last names and you have several people at your company that have the last name of Smith, then you could do Smith1, Smith2, Smith99 and so on and those are all valid usernames.

---

# `-c` Option with `useradd`

Let's go back to the man page of `useradd`..

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203362597-47621246-5a33-47b6-a6b9-f10cb16d2fa8.png)

There is an option to `useradd` command, which is `-c` that allows for comment, and that comment can be any string.

Generally, it's a short description of the log in, and historically it's been used for a person's
name. So if we make Smith1 account and it's for a Jane Smith, then we would put Jane Smith in the comment, so that we know what person is associated with that account.

If the account isn't not for a person, then you can put in the application that's going to use the account.

---

# `-m` Option with `useradd`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203511299-a4f434a6-9334-4414-b0c8-10f4d29c0b60.png)

<!-- 14:30 -->

The `-m` option creates the user's home directory if it does not exist. "By default, if this option is not specified and CREATE_HOME is not enabled, no home directories are created."

 If you want to ensure, a user home directory gets created, then use the `-m` option.

---

# Creating the User

Now let's create a user in the script

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203518197-239cef4e-77f2-452d-937c-0feb2fe9c257.png)

Note: the reason why the `COMMENT` variable is in quotes is because the `COMMENT` may contain spaces. By putting something in quotes, it gets treated as a single argument or a single item and not separate arguments or separate items.

---

# Setting the Password

The command we use to set the password is `passwd`. 

By default, `psswd` prompt you to enter a new password for your account. To change a password for another account, you have to specify that account. Only root can change other people's passwords.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203518889-6ead518c-16c7-4ae6-9e97-a51b88e1a82b.png)

From the above example, this is how we would change the current user's password. 

---

Let's see in the man page if there is a way to supply the password non interactively or in some programmatically or automated fashion.

```yaml
$ man passwd
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203523121-296ab762-549f-42a5-b58d-d5f774995d6a.png)

When you use a pipe symbol on a command line, it means take the standard output from the preceding command, the command that goes before the pipe, and pass it as the standard input to the following command.

If the first command displays error messages, those will not be passed to the second command. Those error messages are called standard error output.

# `-e` To Force User to Change Paassword Firt Time They Login

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203525769-fc75e41f-0ada-4224-8a2b-7d5db2182698.png)

`echo` - We'll use echo to output the provided password and then use that output as standard input to the `passwd` command. 
* `|` - The pipe takes the output of the preceding command, which is echo, takes that output and makes it the standard input for the following command, which is password.
* `--stdin` - We can use the â€“stdin option to take standard input as the password. 
* `${USER_NAME}` - here, we are telling the password command what user that this password belongs to.

# Testing the Script

We want to create an account for a Andy Jones. His username will be ajones and initial password will be ajones123.

`sudo ./luser-demo04.sh ` - because we're adding a user with this script, we need to run this script with root privileges

`su -  ` - acts as a login shell 

`exit` - to log out of the account.

* Learnt about `useradd` and is `-c` option which forces the creation of a home directory when creating an account.
* Learnt how to programmatically supply a password to the `passwd` command by piping the output of echo into the `passwd` command using the `--stdin` option.
* Learnt  how to force a password reset for an account by using `passwd` with a `-e` followed by a username.
